# `contract-harness.mjs` — dev notes

## The three defects it exists for

Each was found by running something, none by reading, and each was in a *copy*:

1. **A re-vendor check its own documentation satisfied.**
   `grep -q "$BASE_DIR" lib/client-config.js` matched the vendor path inside the
   shim's explanatory comment, and returned **PASS across a genuine re-vendor.**
2. **`[ "$rc" = "2" ] && { … }` as an arm's last statement** returns 1 under
   `set -e`, so a **green suite exits 1**. Invisible in the lane it was copied
   *from* — that lane had no suite, so `rc` was always 2 — and it fires on the
   copier's first passing test, reading as *"the tests broke the base adoption"*.
3. **Naming the pin from the worktree rather than the committed gitlink.**
   4 of 5 contracts. Worst under the release gate, because the gate is the thing
   that makes the two differ.

## The carve-out has now been keyed wrong four times, by four people

Each fix corrected the previous keying, in the same file or its copies. Measured
2026-09-26: a lane added the gitlink-divergence check with **zero** occurrences
of `WEBCTL_DECLARED_PIN` and ten of `WEBCTL_BASE_DIR`, and **blocked a release**
when the gate's swap tripped its own new check.

⇒ That is the argument for the library rather than another rule: the rule has
been written down four times and re-derived wrong four times.

### ⭐ And the likely CAUSE, which is worth more than the count

One lane deferred reading `WEBCTL_DECLARED_PIN` *"until I bump, since v0.5.0
does not export it"*. ⛔ **It is not exported by the pinned library at all** —
the gate process sets it in the contract's environment at runtime, so a lane on
any pin receives it.

⇒ So the variable looked like part of base's API, subject to the adoption
ordering every other base capability has, and was deferred on that reasoning.
**Gate-provided env is independent of the consumer's pin**, and saying so is
cheaper than counting the mis-keyings. *(webctl:mgr's diagnosis.)*

## Controls

Every check is exercised in **both** directions against a hermetic fixture repo
built with real `git` objects — not a mocked filesystem, because the defects are
about what `ls-tree` and `describe` actually return.

⭐ **The re-vendor control replays THE SHAPE THAT SHIPPED**: a local file that
defines the surface while mentioning the vendor path only in a comment. *A
synthetic mutation proves a check can fail; replaying the shape that shipped
proves it fails on the thing that happened.*

⚠ And the pin control asserts the carve-out does **not** fire when
`WEBCTL_DECLARED_PIN` is merely *set* to the value already checked out —
otherwise the skip triggers on every gated run and the check is decorative.

## Deliberately not here yet

* **Exercisable under the gate.** The pin check's swap arm is the one path that
  only the release gate produces on demand; it is currently controlled by a
  forged fixture. ⇒ *The forged control is the only one you can schedule; the
  accidental one is a gift.* Running the harness's own checks **during** an
  `--against-head` run would convert the gate into a control, and that is the
  next step rather than a shipped property.
* **The ESM/CJS arm from a consumer.** base uses this natively; a CJS lane
  invokes it as a subprocess, so there is no loader question — but no lane has
  run it yet.
